# Practicing GoLang concepts for peer review 

Description: 

Most of the work I have done so far has been local coding exercises to review certain concepts.  Creating this repository to have 
a centralized location for some of the existing exercises I have done so far that I found particulary enjoyable.  This is also for the 
benefit of anyone that may want to embark on similar exercises of their own.  

At the moment this is a collection of function calls per task/concept I would like to practice more with.  Though this will grow into something more substantial in the 
near future.  My hope is to turn this into a wider project with a more structured format.   I would like to have these use a go file per main concept being practiced in main.go, for example interfaces will have a interface.go file, strucs in a struc.go etc.   

Structure: 

```
------workout
       |---functions.go
       |---api.go
       |---main.go
```

functions.go -- place holder for all practice functions/methods
api.go --place holder for data structures 

Go version being used: 

```
go version
go version go1.22.1
```
